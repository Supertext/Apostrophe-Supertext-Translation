# Supertext Translation for ApostropheCMS

AI translation for [ApostropheCMS](https://apostrophecms.com) by [Supertext](https://www.supertext.com). The module plugs Supertext into Apostrophe's own **Localize…** step: editors select the locales, tick **Translate text content**, and every copy is translated by Supertext AI before Apostrophe saves it as a draft for review.

```js
// app.js
modules: {
  // Then choose each locale's Supertext language in the admin bar: Supertext → Languages
  // (de → de-DE, en → en-US … are preselected; the option `languages` can override it).
  'supertext-apostrophe-translation': {}
}
```

Translates titles and text fields, rich text (a paragraph at a time, with formatting and links kept), the text of other widgets, arrays and objects, and gives new localizations a translated URL. Works for pages and pieces, one at a time or in batches, offers *Export for translation* / *Import translation* (XLIFF 1.2 or HTML files for translation tools, translators or Supertext's web app), and includes a status screen for administrators (with the automatic API key check and a combo box per locale for its Supertext language) and the tasks `check` and `translate`. It sends version information to Supertext (no content, no key; [can be turned off](docs/INSTALLATION.md#version-reports-commando-center)).

## Export for translation and import (XLIFF and HTML)

Besides translating with Supertext AI, you can export a page or piece as a file, have it translated elsewhere and import the result.

- **Where:** *Export for translation* and *Import translation* in the More Options menu of every page and piece, next to *Localize…*.
- **Formats:** XLIFF 1.2 for translation tools such as Trados, memoQ or Phrase (formatting travels as protected tags; several target languages in one file), or HTML (one language per file) for translators or Supertext's web app, which keeps the file's head and `data-st-id` attributes, so the translated file imports as it is.
- **Import:** the file says what it was exported from and for which language. The translations are written with the same rules as a Supertext AI translation, and a summary shows what was imported and what was skipped: source changed since the export (import those anyway with *Also import texts whose source changed since the export*), not translated, formatting changed, not in the file.
- **Safe:** files over 10 MB, files from another system and translations that add markup the source doesn't have are refused; uploaded files aren't stored.
